# Predicting-credit-card-spend-Linear-Regression
Business Problem :-
Company collected data from 5000 customers. The objective of this case study is to understand what's driving the total spend of credit card(Primary Card + Secondary card), Prioritize the drivers based on the importance.

This case required intensive data cleaning/preparation, Factor analysis, correlation matrix, univariate analysis and Linear Regression modeling.

-- Applied data cleaning, linear regression, filtering variables using correlations, influential observations & capturing maximum variance    within data, finally listing key drivers. 
-- Prioritized drivers for credit card spending.
-- The model was developed in both SAS & R tools. 
-- Visualization & Reporting done using Excel.
